### Contains programs written in C and C++ to be run on Ubuntu <br> All projects in this repo were build on *Ubuntu 22.04.01* <br> Projects in this repository focus on different aspect of coding and project management on Ubuntu: `header files`, `abstracts`, `malloc`, `calloc`  `parsing`, `array manipulation`, `pointers`, `modular file design`, `sorting techniques` and `stack`

## Projects:

## [Stack_Data_Structure](https://github.com/evlutz/Operating-Systems/tree/main/Server%20Request%20Handler)

- Uses a `stack structure` to store and reverse the order of strings or characters.
- Modular code by separating the stack structure and reversal functionality into separate modules `stack.c`, `stacktest.c`, and `stacktest2.c
- Uses `doxygen` comments and headers to make the code more readable and maintainable.
- Uses appropriate data types and error checking to prevent errors.


## [String_Manipulation](https://github.com/evlutz/Systems-Programming/tree/main/String_Manipulation)

- Uses `modular programming` to separate the string manipulation functions into a separate module `mystring.c`.
- Uses `doxygen` comments and headers to make the code more readable and maintainable.
- Uses appropriate data types and error checking to prevent errors.
- Ustilizes `structs` to create a database of of `student structs`.


## [Array_Sort](https://github.com/evlutz/Systems-Programming/tree/main/Array_Sort)

- Utilizes `modular programming` to create `reusable code` to sort arrays of integers and floats, includes `bubble sort`.
- Modular programming to separate the array manipulation functionality into separate modules `array_sort.c` and `print_arrays.c`.
- Uses `doxygen` comments and headers to make the code more readable and maintainable.
